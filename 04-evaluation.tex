\section{Evaluation}

This section presents an in-depth empirical analysis of the design discussed in
Section~\ref{design-section}. To this end, we assess the scalability and
efficiency of the solution using multiple criteria.
%
First, an evaluation of the strong scaling behavior of the distributed
algorithm is presented.
%
Second, the weak scaling of the solution is assessed with respect to increasing
numbers of targeted latent communities.
%
Next, the effects of varying the number of latent communities on the system's
performance is analyzed.
%
Further, we evaluate the efficiency and overhead associated with network
communication between cluster nodes.
%
Finally, we contrast the effectiveness of scaling the computation horizontally
and vertically.

Empirical results were obtained by performing experiments on the VU and TU/D
DAS5 clusters which consist of 68 and 48 compute nodes respectively. Each
compute node is equipped with a dual 8-core Intel Xeon E5-2630v3 CPU clocked
at 2.40GHz, 64GB of memory and 8TB of storage. Moreover, the compute nodes of
each site are interconnected by an internal 1~Gbit/s Ethernet and FDR~InfiniBand.
